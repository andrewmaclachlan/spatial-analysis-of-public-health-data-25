# Datasets

Health data can be hard to find online. Here are some interesting datasets i have come across:

-   [UK Small area mental health index / other mental health data](https://ocsi.uk/2020/10/12/neighbourhood-data-on-mental-health/)

-   [UK Understanding society health and wellbeing](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/access-data/)

-   [UK Police data (e.g. for looking at violence and mental wellbeing)](https://data.police.uk/data/)
